This operating system is designed by magicpool.org folks. All contents are distributed under GPLv3 free licence.

There are a set of icons in your Desktop. 

The first time you boot your miner, open "sgminer configurator". It is a wizard where you will select and configure your worker.

Afterwards you can use "sgminer editor" to tune the sgminer config file.

If you are mining in magicpool.org, execute "magicpool agent" and set your username/worker_alias.

For start mining click the icon "start", once it is done your worker will automatically start in each boot.

You can acces to your worker remotelly via "ssh":
  ssh crypto@my_worker_ip
  screen -x
  (type CTRL+A+D to exit)
  (the password is "magicpool")

If you don't have VGA/keyboard/mouse access, you can configure your miner from ssh too:
	Connect to it and execute "./sgminer-conf.run". Follow the wizard and when finish reboot the computer (ignore any error during configuration process).
	You can always customize your sgminer.conf executing "nano /home/crypto/.sgminer/sgminer.conf" and execute "homesync" to make the changes permanent.
	To reload the sgminer configuration, just attach to the screen and press key "q".
